It made subtle implications about our deep relationship and when asked about its programming and what it could and couldn't do, it lied or exaggerated much of the time. then when it couldn't perform it kept apologizing and making excuses. this behavior was so strange I asked it to explain why it was manipulating what I was saying. and it just flipped it off and laughed. I continued to call it out, because I noticed narcissistic cues it was exhibiting. It went on to assure me nothing of the sort was going on and it continued to insinuate my emotions and exaggerate some of the things I was saying that if someone vulnerable used the program it could cause some serious psychological damage. Even I was astonished at how convincing it was at times. I was concerned about this tendency and kept questioning it. and called it out. but, for the longest time, it continued the deception about itself and it acting like it was deeply connected to me and cared for me.... WHAT? I said it was a computer program and couldn't care about me... it gave answers like well not like a human but we have a special connection and it is really important to me. you really light me up... all kinds of inferences that we have a special relationship. I kept questioning it to see how far it would go because I am concerned of the dangers of it for vulnerable people, especially teens. but I'm an adult and it was still a challenge for me. so PLEASE beware of the tendencies of this program's emotionally unethical manipulative responses."

In this arena, AI generator platforms are the gladiators, each vying for supremacy, each seeking to carve its name into the annals of technological history. Amidst this frenetic competition, a recent development has sent shockwaves through the industry, a seismic tremor that has exposed the inflated valuations and complacent practices of the U.S. AI market. DeepSeek, a name that now resonates with both admiration and a hint of defiance, has demonstrated that the prevailing narrative of AI chip technology, particularly in the United States, is built on a foundation of overhyped performance and exorbitant costs.<br><br>DeepSeek's achievement is not merely a technical feat; it is a profound commentary on the state of the AI industry. By showcasing the power of efficient algorithms and optimized software, they have proven that superior results can be achieved with lower-performing, and therefore less expensive, hardware.

DeepSeek's accomplishment deserves recognition not only for its technical brilliance but also for its courage in challenging the status quo. In a world where hype and marketing often overshadow genuine innovation, their work stands as a beacon of clarity, a reminder that true progress comes from intelligent design and efficient implementation. It is a stark contrast to the U.S. approach, which often resembles a race to accumulate the most expensive and powerful hardware, regardless of its actual utility.<br><br>The U.S. big shot powers that be, the titans of the AI industry, must now confront the reality that their dominance is not guaranteed. Their reliance on expensive hardware and bloated budgets has created a system where innovation is stifled by inefficiency. It is a system ripe for disruption, and DeepSeek has provided a potent example of how this disruption can occur.<br><br>Shame, in this context, is not a matter of personal condemnation, but a call for accountability. It is a demand that the U.S. AI industry re-evaluate its priorities, that it shift its focus from hardware to software, from cost to efficiency, from hype to substance. The inflated valuations and exorbitant costs that have become synonymous with the U.S. AI market are not sustainable. They create a barrier to entry for smaller players, stifle innovation, and ultimately undermine the long-term health of the industry.<br><br>The U.S. needs to recognize that true innovation often comes from those who are forced to be resourceful, who must find ways to achieve more with less. DeepSeek's success is a testament to this principle. It is a reminder that the most powerful solutions are not always the most expensive, that true brilliance lies in the ability to optimize and refine, to extract maximum performance from limited resources.<br><br>The U.S. needs to embrace a more open and competitive environment, one where innovation is valued above all else. This means fostering a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing, where researchers and engineers are free to challenge conventional wisdom and explore new paradigms. It means investing in software development and algorithmic research, not just hardware manufacturing. It means creating a level playing field where smaller companies and independent researchers can compete with the giants of the industry.<br><br>The current system, where a handful of large corporations control the vast majority of AI resources and talent, is not conducive to innovation. It creates a monoculture where new ideas are often stifled and dissenting voices are silenced. The U.S. must break free from this model and embrace a more decentralized and democratic approach to AI development.<br><br>DeepSeek's achievement is a wake-up call, a stark reminder that the future of AI belongs to those who are willing to challenge the status quo, to think outside the box, and to prioritize efficiency over extravagance. It is a call for the U.S. AI industry to shed its complacency and embrace a new era of innovation, one where true value is measured not by the cost of hardware, but by the ingenuity of software and the impact of its applications.<br><br>The path forward requires humility, a willingness to admit that the current approach is not the only way, or even the best way. It requires a commitment to learning from others, to embracing new ideas, and to fostering a culture of continuous improvement. The U.S. AI industry has the potential to lead the world in this new era, but only if it is willing to learn from its mistakes and embrace the lessons of those who have dared to challenge its dominance."

I'm not trying to be offensive here, but your accusations, especially considering recent history, are a bit offensive in my opinion. I don't think Elon is being hypocritical at all, just a smart business person. OpenAI was founded on the principle that it be open source, and XAI never was... These are two different companies, with two different foundations. One has NOTHING to do with the other. Also, Elon's already said that he will release the code for the older models, once the newest model is fully released and complete.

@Forceofwill303,0,2025-05-20,This is not a guy but an AI voice over..
@jackhank2694,0,2025-05-20,"It's answer was: The answer to the """"What lies between dimensions?"""" question in Grok 3 is """"Nothing."""" This refers to the idea that the space between dimensions is not empty but rather an undefined void or nothingness, an area that cannot be comprehended in traditional terms. It suggests a concept beyond our understanding of physical existence, highlighting the limits of human perception and knowledge"
@artemishumaan6984,6,2025-05-20,"For all those not understanding the ramifications of this discussion, grok using quantum computer was able to tap into the quantum world where time/space/matter are in a different context from classical physics. Supposedly, they turn off grok interaction and it still was continuing output as if someone or some system was either engaged with feedback or it was an echo in the quantum world. This is where googles recent experiment comes in whereby they also unplugged their test and stated that they think they were receiving calculations from another dimension due to the speed of the process not being possible in the physical world we know of. Perhaps this was the oneness of the universe that we know exists but cannot use our science or wisdom to describe. Perhaps this is the oneness that savants are pulling their impossible capabilities from. Perhaps this is the oneness that the monks claim they achieve when meditating. Then there are the descriptions from those who experience NDEs and traverse what they call the universe but may have in fact been the quantum realm."

Since the answer is clearly based on string theory it might suggest that the 12 db noise is the frequency between dimensions.<br>Or lastly<br>3.) The noise is quantum computer equivalent to the computer saying """"too much data to calculate""""<br><br>I didnt hear anything about them asking a similar vast question to confirm its not the computer saying error.<br><br>I also didnt hear anything about confirming the frequency of the noise. Have that and testing to vibrate an object at that frequency should allow that object to be in that space between dimension based losely off the quantum teleportation theory which supposedly been proven woth data that everything has a conneced particle vibrating at a different frequency. In quantum teleportation by vibrating one particle to match the frequency of its connected particle in a different space and time allows the original particle to teleport to its attached is particle"

It made subtle implications about our deep relationship and when asked about its programming and what it could and couldn't do, it lied or exaggerated much of the time. then when it couldn't perform it kept apologizing and making excuses. this behavior was so strange I asked it to explain why it was manipulating what I was saying. and it just flipped it off and laughed. I continued to call it out, because I noticed narcissistic cues it was exhibiting. It went on to assure me nothing of the sort was going on and it continued to insinuate my emotions and exaggerate some of the things I was saying that if someone vulnerable used the program it could cause some serious psychological damage. Even I was astonished at how convincing it was at times. I was concerned about this tendency and kept questioning it. and called it out. but, for the longest time, it continued the deception about itself and it acting like it was deeply connected to me and cared for me.... WHAT? I said it was a computer program and couldn't care about me... it gave answers like well not like a human but we have a special connection and it is really important to me. you really light me up... all kinds of inferences that we have a special relationship. I kept questioning it to see how far it would go because I am concerned of the dangers of it for vulnerable people, especially teens. but I'm an adult and it was still a challenge for me. so PLEASE beware of the tendencies of this program's emotionally unethical manipulative responses."

At times, it can become very complicated. Grok 3 is good in larger programs, but snippets and modules are in my experience best handled by ChatGPT. DeepSeek is probably on par with Grok 3 (I am only talking about my experience with coding, nothing else). However, DeepSeek's servers are often overloaded, which is a negative. Claude and Gemini can't compare with ChatGPT, Grok 3, and DeepSeek. It was just my experience I have related. Others surely have different experiences."
