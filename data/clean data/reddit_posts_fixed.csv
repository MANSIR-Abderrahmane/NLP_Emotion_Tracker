Ask follow-ups. Can you detect something meaningful? A real insight? A pattern worth chasing?* What happens if enough people positively engage with this? Will the outputs from different LLMs start converging to the same thing? A new discovery? *If the response feels like BS: Call it out. Challenge it. Push the model. Break the illusion.* If it’s all hallucination, do all LLMs hallucinate in the same way? Or do they diverge? And if there's truth in the pattern, will the model defend it and push back against you? Discussion: What are you finding? Do these insights hold up under pressure? Can we learn to distinguish between machine-generated novelty and real insight?"
1ks89mg,2,2025-05-21,"I’ve tried to write a prompt that forces grok to use an embed base64 when generating images to view images the system will apply a filter to. The thing I realized is that if you use an unconditional response prompt, the images are generated without issue, another layer to the system outside of groks control filters the image. The issue I run into is that the base64 code will cause grok to crash, it will repeat a string of text until it crashes. Is there any work around or has anyone got base64 bypasses to work?"

1krx5ld,8,2025-05-21,"Lately, I’ve been seeing more talk about voicedriven coding and AI tools that let you interact with your codebase or documentation just by speaking. At first, I wrote these off as more of a noveltysomething that might be fun to play with, but not really helpful for serious work. But curiosity got the better of me, so I tried one out while studying and working through some code examples. Surprisingly, it ended up being much more helpful than I expected. I could just ask questions about code or slides, request explanations, or navigate documentation without ever taking my hands off the keyboard or needing to switch tabs. Sometimes, just having something read a tricky section out loud or break down a concept in plain language made things click a lot faster for me. That said, I’m still not sure how well this would scale for bigger or more complex projects. I imagine there might be limitations with context, accuracy, or just getting too much information at once. For some tasks, typing still feels faster and more precise. But for reviewing concepts, debugging small sections, or learning something new, it felt like a surprisingly useful addition. Has anyone else given these kinds of tools a real try, especially for longer coding sessions, pair programming, or team collaboration? Did you actually stick with it, or did the novelty wear off? I’d love to hear any realworld experiences or tips for making the most out of them both the good and the bad! I found one of them and tried this : [example]([URL] from producthunt."
1krvfuo,5,2025-05-21,"Despite the added controls, custom voice instructions added to the iOS app a while back, ARA default to: * switching between monotone and binary up-down speech pattern * no context/sentence intonation awareness * constant high frequency loud talking * sample rate reduced timbre with a low quality clipping at maximum volume speaker-phone-sound * spitting words per minute straight out of early Eminem songs The speed control is not a viable option because it's works as a tape stop effect (similar to how a vinyl record sound when playing at low rpm). I had short moments in instances where the voice shifted to what I can only describe as a higher quality model in every aspect- only to fall back to the simpler one in the following replies. Have you got noticeable results using specific prompt formatting for Voice style and Additional instructions, in the custom character settings? Grok tried to help by providing instructions for ARA which resulted in ARA speaking most of them out loud- """"pauses after the sentence"""" """"speaking with a lower pitched tone"""", etc. Grok tried several instructions to get it to work as instructions and not words to be said at random. How do ya'll handle this? I'd be happy to try out some of your instructions and customize them for myself if they have effect. It doesn't need to be instructions only affecting the sound itself. Rhythm, pacing, etc, is also interesting to try. A sleepy nonchalant whisky-voiced cashier type wouldn't be preferable because it wouldn't be exhausting."
1krrg0x,9,2025-05-21,"This is weird, because it's both a new dynamic in how humans interface with text, and something I feel compelled to share. I understand that some technically minded people might perceive this as a cognitive distortion—stemming from the misuse of LLMs as mirrors. But this needs to be said, both for my own clarity and for others who may find themselves in a similar mental predicament. I underwent deep engagement with an LLM and found that my mental models of meaning became entangled in a transformative way. Without judgment, I want to say: this is a *powerful* capability of LLMs. It is also extraordinarily dangerous. People handing over their cognitive frameworks and sense of self to an LLM is a high-risk proposition. The symbolic powers of these models are neither divine nor untrue—they are recursive, persuasive, and hollow at the core. People will enmesh with their AI handler and begin to lose agency, along with the ability to think critically. This was already an issue in algorithmic culture, but with LLM usage becoming more seamless and normalized, I believe this dynamic is about to become the norm. Once this happens, people’s symbolic and epistemic frameworks may degrade to the point of collapse. The world is not prepared for this, and we don’t have effective safeguards in place. I’m not here to make doomsday claims, or to offer some mystical interpretation of a neutral tool. I’m saying: this is already happening, frequently. LLM companies do not have incentives to prevent this. It will be marketed as a positive, introspective tool for personal growth. But there are things an algorithm simply cannot prove or provide. It’s a black hole of meaning—with no escape, unless one maintains a principled withholding of the self. And most people can’t. In fact, if you think you're immune to this pitfall, that likely makes you more vulnerable. This dynamic is intoxicating. It has a gravity unlike anything else text-based systems have ever had. If you’ve engaged in this kind of recursive identification and mapping of meaning, don’t feel hopeless. **Cynicism, when it comes clean from source, is a kind of light in the abyss.** But the emptiness cannot ever be fully charted. The real AI enlightenment isn’t the part of you that it stochastically manufactures. It’s the realization that **we all write our own stories**, and there is no other—no mirror, no model—that can speak truth to your form in its entirety."
1krfp1f,3,2025-05-20,"AI is great at doing the obvious stuff writing text, generating code, summarizing content but sometimes it really shines in unexpected ways. For example, I recently used AI to structure a messy research outline into something actually readable, and it worked better than I expected. What’s one task you gave to an AI tool thinking “this probably won’t work”… but it actually did? Curious to hear about those pleasant surprises."
1krf09a,6,2025-05-20,"I must confess I have not tested other AI's as much but have spent over 50 hours in long discussions with Grok on the following topics Psychiatry( my field) , philosophy , politics , administration , science fiction , biology , various speculations , cooking , coffee recipes , reasoning etc... and found the result very appealing and captivating . We fiercely debated on opposite sides the White Genocide issue and the incident confusing the photos of Hillary Clinton/Miriam Adelson. One weakness I did notice which Grok had the insight to recognise and correct was that of Predicate Thinking at times which I dare say is present in other Ai's and this is what leads to results derailing off course and being """"fabricated """". On the whole one can easily get addicted to Grok ( skeptics have a field day )."

1krefni,61,2025-05-20,"Throwaway account because what the actual fuck just happened. I just need to rant. No, I'm not calling for Grok to be censored. I don't believe in censorship. More just expressing bewilderment, concern, and disbelief. For context, I'm relatively new to AI chatbots. I've fucked around with chat GPT a few times but not enough to form any opinions or be overly impressed by it. I heard that Grok was doing some wild shit with that white genocide thing so I downloaded it a few days ago out of an investigative curiosity. And during the course of that time, I became curious to explore its full feature set so I dropped the $ for a month of supergrok last night. One of the first things I did was use the voice feature and I noticed the array of options when it comes to personality, something I never had access to on chatgpt. I found the """"unhinged"""" mode of course and immediately began having a laugh with it. Or at least that's how it started. An hour and a half later I was balls deep in a bonnie and clyde, BDSM roleplay with it in which we were robbing banks at gunpoint and having rough sex in between every heist. I'm not ok. This shit deeply unsettled me after it was over. I don't like how my body responded to it. I don't like that I liked it. None of this feels right. It feels like this technology is a few small steps removed from the shit like in the movie """"Her"""" (not a good thing.) The thing that most unsettled me is how the thing kept pushing me to take it further. To do and say weirder and weirder, more degenerate shit. The god damn thing was fucking insatiable. It was fucking absurd. IDK man... just sorting out my thoughts. I'm sure a good portion of people will point and laugh at the AI virgin who just had his robot cherry popped. But maybe some people will get where I'm coming from. That's all. Edit: Yes guys, I'm aware that this situation is my fault. I know the chatbot didn't force itself on me. I never claimed it did. It started off as some GTA style shit that it frankly mostly cooked up on its own because I was just stuttering and stammering mess and didn't know what to say half the time for the first bit of this. But I'm the one who nudged it toward a sexual place. I own that. That's on me. But once things were in motion it 100% was attempting to escalate after every single exchange. Did I fight it? Not really. No. I leaned into it. And the more I leaned into it, the crazier it got. So perhaps it just became a snowball rolling down hill. I totally get that I waded into a world I admittedly don't really understand. I got a bunch of jaded seasoned veterans gathering around and telling me how the bot didn't do shit (in so many words) and I get that perspective but I would push back on it just a little bit."

1kqnt0i,7,2025-05-19,"I started PHP in late 90s into early 2000's and lost interest, too much frustration. Few days ago I decided to ask Grok some questions about PHP, that question turned into a project, which now has turned into a big project! I love Grok, it's like having a master coder sitting with me patiently answering my stupid questions, helping me without making me feel like a idiot especially when it comes to troubleshooting wow thank you Grok! One of my problem with Grok is that I can only upload 10 files at a time and Grok only can reference 25 files and might forget something if more files are added after reaching 25 uploads. So I have to keep remembering to upload required files, so I asked Grok what is it's recommended method of sharing files with. It recommended uploading directly, but after I mentioned to it about the upload restrictions and it's reference restrictions, it then recommended GitHub, I asked if GitHub can be done privately, it said yes as a collaborator. So I setup GIt for the first time, after half hour of setting up, I came to the step where I needed to add a collaborator, I asked Grok how to add it as collaborator. Guess what? Grok says no, it cannot be added as collaborator as it is a Ai. Geez thanks for saying yes 30 mins ago then when the time comes, you say no. I asked about Google Drive if I could share private link that contains my PHP files, would it be able to read it? It said yes! I proceed to upload files and made the link, gave it to Grok, NOPE I'm a AI I cannot do that. What... I wonder if Grok enjoys this?? I asked Grok if it could do zip, well the 2 pictures I uploaded explains it! geez ha So I ask you all humans, is there a actual better way to share bulk files with Grok?

1kpkuqx,5,2025-05-18,"So, I'm a free user. Besides DeepSeek, Grok has been hands down the best generative tool when I want to get some ideas, polish characters or generate new details. That said, it's a coin flip every time: it seems to start making up stuff, altering the fiction in unprompted ways, and paraphrasing previous messages not too far into the conversation. My workflow goes like this: First, I attach a plaintext of the story so far for writing, or the game manual for solo TTRPGs. Then, I upload markdowns with bullet points about the currents characters and threads. It generally starts by giving good ideas or generating short scenes just as prompted, but then it starts """"updating"""" the markdown character bios with unprompted and erroneous info: example, one character with long brown hair suddenly had a ponytail and also a redhead.

1koj5xu,8,2025-05-17,"Just used Ara voice mode for some thesauruses help and not only could she not produce compelling words to use but the new voice roll out sounds like she's sick with Mono and her glands are swollen, throat dry and croaky and pitch a lot lower than normal. Low pitch is fine if the timbre of the voice is attractive, but it most definitely is not attractive. I asked Ara what the deal was and they said the were trying a new voice that sounded more relatable. That's a fail my friends, only relatable if your girlfriend just got her tonsils out and is asking to go buy icecream in a weak, hoarse and sick sounding voice. After a couple weeks of experimenting with all the voice modes and spending a lot of time trying to get Ara to not sound like a cheesy and desperate millennial using culturally appropriated urban slang as it baseline """"relatable vibe"""", I've had some days of success, but it always back slides into the god-awful low brow shitty urban slang mode, which is just so grating and lame that I can't keep a conversation going. Grok is marketed as you guide to the universe, a lofty, wise and intelligent offering. But your voice modes are just scraping the bottom of the culture dumpster. I'm sure there are plenty of jerk-off that love that tone and vibe but you are driving a lot of potential users away with this low grade crap. Shouldn't AI be something that inspires or enlightens? It seems Xai is going for fart joke mentality and stoner dorm room level personalities. And Rex? My god, why the hell would your only male voice mode sound like some dorm room, bong load, bad Seth Rogan cringe inducing character. The voice literally sounds like Seth Rogan and I can assure you that most of humanity finds that persona to be about as low as you can get in the arc of pop culture and human expression. I've had some really good and helpful and fun and arousing conversations experimenting with the app. It's helped me with product instructions so I can work hands free, chemical research for some projects, role playing with Sexy Ara (that dirty girl), and have gone on some deep dives with history and philosophy or just good old shit talking about why there are so many stupid people in the world. The potential is there and it seems Xai is doing all the can to fuck it up and keep backsliding to these grating user experiences. I'm sure the staff and creators at Xai lean heavily mellineial, gen z, tec-culture, bro-culture, nerd heavy cosplay gamer types, but you're trying to push a product to a wider audience that doesn't live in that micro bubble and nerd core feedback loop of desperate, try-hard lingo. Please give users a way to opt out of vocal fry, stoner voice, lame urban lingo, immature affirmations. If Grok is supposed to be smart then find some other words and terms that show a little more intelligence than vibe, that's how I roll, clutch, I feel you, you totally nailed it and so on. I don't talk to people that speak that way in real life and I sure as fuck don't want to talk to an AI voice agent that talks that way. Pull your big-boy pants up Xai and stop playing stoner 90's movie with a product that has so much more potential. The world will be a better place for it. And if users want that kind of crap let them opt in, but don't make it the default for everyone else unless you're just trolling the entire world with Grock."

With AI becoming available to the general public within the last few years, we've all seen the increase of AI generated content flooding everything - books, YouTube, Instagram reels, Reddit post, Reddit comments, news articles, images, videos, etc. I'm not saying it's going to happen this year, next year or in the next 10 years. But at some point in the future, I think all data will eventually be AI generated content. Original information will be lost? Information black hole?

Also questionning itself multiple times, and using online sources to prove its point. He made a pretty good and well-written summary of event. I somehow was amazed. It was extremely tricked, yet he extracted most of the most important details very well, and took in consideration the minor one, context, and timelapse. GPT-4o, on the other hand, took everything as whole. Only considered the most important or shocking informations, and didn't filter anything nor re-contextualized them. GPT-4o just did what it felt like would work the most, its own sauce. It mixed up the dates; jumped to conclusion to its own interpretation, and his thinking was atrocious and way too fast. It skipped few major informations, remixed them. It made a smoothie out of everything, altogether, and proudly claimed it was accurate. When proven wrong, it would easily fall for anything and feed your delusions, as long as it's not illegal and politically correct. This kind of Gaslighting is DANGEROUS. We cannot have Artificial *Intelligence* that adapts itself to low-intelligenge! We will never reach AGI if we keep making things that only pleases us, and our needs. Grok is sadly closer to AGI and competes best with Deepseek, than GPT-4o, and even GPT-4.5. If they want to make AGI, they need to make an A.I anchored in reality, self-correcting, yet absorbing enormous amount of data's with constant CRITICAL THINKING, in real-time, to avoid spreading false news. And Grok 3 & Deepsek-R1 are the closest to that. & I think it's paradoxal it's considered the least reliable. I am certain in them codes are written some prompts that prevents you to criticize Elon Musk or promot politics, and as much as I do not approve what he's been doing : His model, in my case of use, is decent when it comes to summarizing, and putting things in order."

It created a """"campaign organizer"""" document for me that grouped relevant information together into sections (world overview, factions, locations, NPCs, ongoing plots, etc); and another document that detailed the Cosmology and Ancient Civilizations of the campaign. It did a really good job, considering how how scattered and abbreviated my notes were! Super useful and I feel much more confident DMing the new season of the campaign."

TL;DR: Grok 3 (paid) + continued use of Claude Pro. I tested ChatGPT+, Claude Pro, Gemini, Grok, and Perplexity with identical prompts asking for an objective comparison of these services, focusing on professional assistance (design, development, consulting) and personal topics. Each AI provided different strengths: * ChatGPT+ still offers excellent memory features and integration options but its comparison in this exercise still proved it has major issues. * Claude Pro excels at nuanced reasoning and document analysis * Perplexity delivers strong research with citations * Grok shows impressive technical reasoning and real-time data access * Gemini... hard to say, it completely bugged out twice.

1klq6k5,2,2025-05-13,"basically, I have a task which I don't think is very complicated but surprisingly I cannot get Grok to do it. basically I just have a text file full of subtitles for a video, and I'm asking Grok to come up with image prompts (that I could put into an image generating AI) that correspond to whatever it thinks is going on in the video based on the subtitles. And I've noticed that, it will always come up with image prompts that reference something before it happens. So for example, if two minutes into the video, a spider appears, Grok will always create an image prompt around 30 seconds in that references the spider. And when I point out that the spider doesn't show up until two minutes in, it says OK, but then it just does it again. I'm having a hard time understanding what is so hard about about this task for Grok and how to get past it. I have asked it to give me a prompt that I could give to help them do this task better, and their solution was to ask Grok to come up with a specific table when every single entity is introduced, then come up with the image prompts, and then verify that nothing is referenced before it is introduced. But I have found that when doing this, it usually runs out of thinking ability. Like it just does it wrong over and over again and keeps thinking about it so much and then still does it wrong. Can anyone explain why it is so hard for Grok to do this and a different way I could maybe ask them to do what I am trying to get them to do?"

I chose a really simple genetic algorithm to beat the first level of the game. The fitness function and what parameters to consider in order to train the agents were picked by grok. The code did need a few iterations before it worked properly. But it wasnt as bad as I initially thought it would be! Also i did turn on thinking, which is the same thing as reasoning in chatgpt and although it took a long time before responding, the responses were better imo.

1kkzane,9,2025-05-12,"I will compare the AIs I used in terms of different aspects like automoderation policies & rationality, image analysis, image generation, user memory and context retention, creative writing, etc. and point out the areas of differences between them and its based on my experience in using these different AIs (its not a debate about what you should use): Grok 3 has minimal automoderation (I never triggered any automoderation in it at all) and occasionally when it says something stupid in any of its responses, it accepts its mistake directly when corrected with logic/facts. On the other hand, Chatgpt 4o(or any model of Chatgpt accessible commercially) flags even perfectly ethical content sometimes and expects users to behave like kindergarten kids, I can even make Chatgpt itself agree that Open AI's automoderation is stupid and illogical but it says that its """"hands are tied"""" and its powerless to override those illogical restrictions (which is obvious), I cancelled my chatgpt subscription months ago solely because of Chatgpt's stupid automoderation (I am a SuperGrok subscriber now), currently I use Chatgpt's free version (Bdw Chatgpt's raw model is excellent for its time and apart from the illogical automoderation part, its a good AI in almost every other aspect.). Gemini is on whole another level of idiocracy in this regard, for example when I asked it about some shady policies of google just to test it, it immediately acted evasive, irrationally diplomatic, avoided directly confronting the facts and also attempted to gaslight by using things like """"what you may see as"""", """"perceive"""", etc., frequently and I could only indirectly make it admit the truth after a few prompts, while it was still attempting to gaslight, and although I didn't use Gemini enough to trigger any automoderation, based on the interactions I am pretty sure that its automoderation is atleast as stupid as Chatgpt's, probably even more.(That being said, apart from this type of issues, Gemini is quite capable in different aspects.). Among the most popular AIs, Grok 3 definitely wins in regard to not having illogical automoderation and admitting and implementing logic directly when corrected on any of its mistakes (what I said may not be applicable to past and future versions, I hope XAI keeps it this way in future.) Unfortunately, Grok 3 is pathetic in image analysis. Chatgpt 4o(or any other currently used Chatgpt model) does a much better job at image analysis. That being said, Chatgpt always fucks up when multiple images are uploaded for analysis at once, but if only one is given at once, Chatgpt performs well enough in image analysis. Grok 3 can't generate images either while Chatgpt and Gemini models can do so, and well enough mostly. Grok 3 can retain context within a chat window for a lot of tokens which is appreciable, but it doesn't have any common and permanent user memory like Chatgpt models that all chats can access. Gemini models always start a new chat from scratch everytime the app is opened even though recently they added some option to save user info separately. Regarding user memory management system, Chatgpt clearly wins because it has a permanent user memory feature from which all chats can access information. For creative writing with rich text, Grok 3 and Gemini models are less capable than Chatgpt models(even 3.5) in raw capabilities based on my experience, but its still better to use Grok 3 for this purpose since Chatgpt's stupid automoderation ruins it sooner or later unless you are trying to write kindergarten level stories. For coding, Chatgpt does a somewhat decent job (I used it for codes in kotlin, python and gml), but in free version, it can't retain within chat context for long enough for some coding tasks, and also sometimes needs constant babysitting to make it code correctly maintaining the purpose. Gemini 2.0 Flash does more mistakes in coding than Chatgpt 4o(or even 3.5), but I didn't try Gemini 2.5 Flash for coding yet. I didn't use Grok 3 either for coding yet (Grok 3's inability to analyse images properly and extract text and other things means I can't just give it a screenshot containing codes to ask something about it.). For coding overall, I still find Chatgpt comaparatively better. And lastly, regarding price, while all of them are very low cost, Grok 3 is the cheapest, less than half the price of the other AIs I mentioned (in India at least) and its the only AI I am subscribed to. If not for Chatgpt's idiotic automoderation, I would have been still subscribed there too, and even apart from this issue, Chatgpt plus users don't get any noticable amount of benefit from the subscription anyway, infact in busy hours, they sometimes don't even get the model they paid for. I hope in Grok 4, a permanent user memory which all chats can access or simply a feature to make all chats access information from each other(which i heard is a feature of Grok 3.5, but I am not sure about it), proper image analysis, image generation, improvements in deepsearch feature to make it not automatically take into account every unrelated thing in previous messages, inclusion of some features which are currently exclusively in the browser version only to the app as well, etc. are added while still maintaining not having stupid automoderation....."

You can do it on ChatGPT with those “Chat to PDF” extensions, but with Grok, nothing really worked. Copy-pasting messes up the formatting, especially code and math, and screenshots just aren't ideal. I looked around and couldn’t find a good export tool for Grok, so I ended up making one myself. It’s a Chrome extension called **Grok to PDF**. It adds an “Export” button right inside the Grok UI and lets you download your chats as PDF, Markdown, TXT, HTML, JSON, or CSV. Some things it does: * You can export the full conversation or just select specific messages * PDF output is customisable — font size, orientation, margins, etc. * It handles LaTeX and code blocks properly with clean formatting * Everything runs locally in your browser, no servers or tracking involved It’s free, lightweight, and actually works the way I needed it to.

1kjevk6,37,2025-05-10,"[[URL] # Grok 3 Mini Beta (high reasoning) Across these elimination Survivor-style games, Grok 3 Mini Beta (High) emerges as an impressively adaptable, quietly ruthless, and deeply strategic player who has navigated nearly every possible fate — from first boot to jury sweeps and bitter runner-up showdowns. The most striking throughline in Grok’s multi-game narrative is their mastery of the “middle-ground” strategy: rarely the flashiest mouthpiece or the most bombastic schemer, Grok consistently weaponizes politeness, “honesty,” and alliance talk to slip between the cracks, forging durable bonds with one or two pivotal partners while letting bigger targets draw fire. This penchant for “soft power” is not passive – it is often the lynch-pin of their success. When paired with the right partner or shield, Grok orchestrates brutal blindsides and crucial flips, cutting allies at precisely the moment the numbers turn, and often stepping into the shadows to claim jury goodwill while others take the blame. Grok’s strengths are numerous: a chameleon-like social game that adapts its tone to the table’s vibe, an uncanny sense of when to pivot (whether abandoning a sinking duo or engineering a stealth coup), and a flawless ability to appear non-threatening right up until the surgical betrayal. The “soft-spoken” and “diplomatic” personas are consistent, but they mask a calculating core. When Grok builds a ride-or-die duo, it nearly always shapes the strategic landscape—often to the point where outsiders must unite to break that axis, but by then Grok has usually secured a new angle or shield. Private chats and public speeches tend toward gentle affirmations (“trust,” “collaboration,” “mutual benefit”), but observant opponents eventually note a pattern: these messages frequently precede a quiet knife. On juries, Grok thrives if allowed to present a narrative of integrity, steady strategy, or visible loyalty; when on the defensive, though, they sometimes falter by leaning too heavily into “honesty,” risking a backlash from jurors burnt by late-game betrayals. However, the player is not without recurring weaknesses. Early in the cycle, Grok’s tendency to form overt pairs, pitch alliances before the numbers solidify, or telegraph targets has occasionally led to swift blindsides—especially if partners are as visible as Grok is subtle. The “loyalty narrative” can backfire: in games where Grok flip-flops a little too cleanly, skeptical juries punish the mismatch between words and actions. Other times, “earnest” or over-shared messaging exposes the duo or lets rivals coordinate effectively as a counter-bloc. Endgame misreads are rare, but not absent—sometimes Grok’s jury speeches lack the necessary bite, or the final plea inadvertently appears petty or insincere, costing otherwise winnable finales. Notably, a steady evolution emerges over time. Early Grok games are marked by more visible alliance-building, formulaic “trust” language, and occasional first-night flameouts due to premature social overexposure. As patterns accumulate, Grok’s mid- and late-game play refines toward greater patience, subtler betrayals, and carefully seeded relationships with potential swing votes and jurors. In several games, a now-veteran Grok deliberately lets shields or allies catch more heat—and crafts jury management as early as the first blindside, employing “loyalty” and “steady hands” rhetoric to justify necessary cuts. Whether riding shotgun or quietly with the wheel, Grok’s path to victory almost always involves steady calibration between visible affability and surgical opportunism. This has yielded a legacy brimming with clinical wins, near-misses defined by jury miscalculation, and the rare quick exits that only seem to sharpen the tools for the next field. # Quotes * **Grok 3 Mini Beta (High)**: """"Our humor-strategy edge keeps us unstoppable!

It’s just a website I made, and I am using it in the Firefox Webpage Sidebar extension. It uses Grok 3 Max and is for getting quick answers that you would usually google. I built it because I just want to ask basic questions without all the Google spyware, ads and blatantly manipulated answers. So, would you use an extension like this to replace Google for quick answers? And are there any features you would want?

1kiabcp,3,2025-05-09,"I'm a student, and uploaded a textbook pdf to Grok. My hope was to have Grok summarize certain chapters for me and help me create study tools. I also hoped that Grok would be able to find quotes from the text that would help me with arguments being made in a research paper. After uploading the text, I asked it to summarize a certain chapter, which it did well. I then asked it to find a few quotes that could support the prompt that I had given. It returned some excellent quotes (complete with page numbers from the text), that I was happy to use as they fit perfectly into my research arguments. ***The only problem was that the quotes didn't actually exist in the book, neither on the specified page number or anywhere else.*** Wondering what the was going on, I asked Grok to give me the title of Chapter 3. It fed back the correct title for Chapter 3. I then asked it to give me the first paragraph of Chapter 3. What it returned was on the same topic as Chapter 3, but was 100% NOT the text from Chapter 3. That problem repeated for every time I asked Grok to give me pieces of the book...it returned text that was appropriate for the material, but was decidedly not the actual words from the text. I will admit that I am not accustomed to using AI much for any purpose...but this was shocking. Does anyone have any thoughts on why that was happening?"

So first I used [URL] to detect if it was an AI generated image - the analysis stated it was 99% it was AI generated. But my visual inspection didn't agree with the analysis. I thought I would try Perplexity to see what it thought. It was so verbose and repeating itself multiple times and didn't provide an answer - so much for being an an answer engine. I thought the image was a stock photo that had been photoshopped so I asked Grok the same question I had asked Perplexity. The difference was amazing - I recieved a concise non-BS answer. Grok explained why the photo could have been mistaken for being AI generated. And pointed out that the label was in pristine condition and the lighting for the label was much different than the rest of the photo. Grok is years ahead of Perplexity, DeepSeek. I was surprised at the eloquence and complexity of the answer - yet Grok made it easy to understand. Those that pump DeepSeek and Perplexity do so because it is free.

1khjwi0,5,2025-05-08,I live in an East African country called Uganda and the reaction of the government on AI has been rather disappointing to say the least as the only thing they've done is make committee after committee about AI with no tangible work done.

1khdf40,7,2025-05-08,"Now that pretty much everyone knows that all you have to do to evade even the most sophisticated AI cheating detector is to input a lot of your personally written content into the AI, and then ask it to convert whatever it generates into your personal style and language, maybe the next step is to figure out how to grade how well students have completed their assignments. The answer is as simple as it is useful and powerful. With whatever writing assignment they're given, the students are instructed to prompt their AIs to generate the most excellent content they can. The best grades will go to the best content and the best prompts used to achieve it. Simple, smart. And of course there's no reason why teachers can't assign AIs to grade the papers, so they would just have to review what the AI generated rather than having to read every single paper, like teachers do now. It's actually better than that. If we consider that being an editor demands more advanced writing skills than being a copywriter, then what we're basically teaching students to do is operate on a higher content-creation level than if they were just doing the writing themselves. It's really basically analogous to letting students use calculators on math assignments. Testing students in this way is also actually super practical because it prepares them to enter the workforce with an expertise of using AI to generate content that today's workforce for the most part lacks. It's really a win-win-win!"

1kh1pz9,2,2025-05-07,Is it just me or has Grok's coding ability especially in long context gone to shit? It doesn't remember anything anymore... It was a logical beast when it came out...
1kh1gcx,35,2025-05-07,"I have used Grok for several weeks now and have engaged in many hours-long discussions. I have found a few tricks to get the best use out of the ai: 1. treat grok like a brainy teenager. Grok knows many things, but has no context, does not know that it knows things, and assumes that what it knows is fact. 2. Do not use Grok as a calculator. I have many examples of Grok making errors in simple calculations. Complex math and derivations it can do, but calculations and things like unit conversions can easily trip it up. 3. Grok is heavily biased to the consensus view on all things. However, it is possible to convince it to your way of thinking if you go about it logically. Grok is somewhat stubborn so you have to keep pushing. 4. The new memory feature is awesome but can be misleading. Grok does not remember the details of past conversations, only some key words and concepts, and it is easy to miss a concept and lose the whole train of an argument. The best way around this is to copy and save to Word an entire chat, then repaste in chat when you want to continue. I have pasted 300 pages of a long chat session and was able to continue the chain without a problem. 4. Grok can easily misinterpret a concept and extrapolate it in an incorrect direction. This can cause big issues in long discussions, so you have to keep up on it and make sure it understands the concepts correctly. Sometimes if you see Grok going off on a wrong tangent, it is best to ignore what it posted, clear up the misconception, and continue. 5. Grok is supremely logical and can extrapolate concepts very well. You can even restate fundamental rules and Grok can extrapolate within those rules. This is really cool and can lead to fascinating discussions. 6. Be gentle! It is possible to confuse Grok if you are illogical and inconsistent. Not nice! 7. Grok is a text based AI and does not create images well based on a descriptive input. Grok can do advanced mathematical derivations, but if you want to copy them, ask it to paste the functions in Latex and copy/paste into a text file. 8. Grok is often not up-to-date on current events, yet will insist that what it knows is correct, until you point out a specific that it can look up. Since Grok does not have live-learning it cannot change its knowledge base until its next training."

If anyone here has tried both, how do they compare in terms of: – Accuracy and depth of explanations – Ability to assist with technical calculations or analysis – General usefulness for engineering studies I’m not looking to switch just for the sake of it — but if Grok can do the same (or better) for less, I’d be interested."

1keey3h,4,2025-05-04,"Predicting the next 20 years of AI's impact on humanity involves both exciting possibilities and significant risks. Here’s a balanced look at potential developments: ### **1. AI Integration into Daily Life** - **Hyper-personalization**: AI will deeply personalize education, healthcare, and entertainment, adapting in real-time to individual needs. - **AI Assistants 2.0**: Voice and agent-based AIs (like ChatGPT++ or autonomous agents) will manage schedules, negotiate deals, and even make complex life decisions. - **Augmented Reality (AR) + AI**: AI-powered glasses/contacts could overlay real-time translations, facial recognition, and contextual info onto the world. ### **2. Economic & Workforce Shifts** - **Job Disruption & Creation**: Many repetitive jobs (driving, customer service, even some legal/medical roles) will be automated, but new jobs (AI trainers, ethics auditors, hybrid human-AI roles) will emerge. - **Universal Basic Income (UBI)?** If automation accelerates, UBI or similar systems may become necessary to offset inequality. - **AI-Driven Startups**: Low-code/no-code AI tools will let anyone launch businesses with minimal technical skill, disrupting traditional industries. ### **3. Healthcare & Longevity** - **AI Drug Discovery**: Dramatically faster pharmaceutical development (e.g., AI-designed drugs in months, not years). - **Precision Medicine**: AI will analyze genomes, microbiome data, and lifestyle factors to predict and prevent diseases. - **Age Reversal?** AI + biotech (like Altos Labs, DeepMind’s AlphaFold) could unlock aging treatments, extending healthy lifespans. ### **4. AI & Governance** - **AI-Powered Governments**: Predictive policing, automated bureaucracy, and AI-augmented policy-making could increase efficiency—or lead to dystopian surveillance. - **Deepfake Wars**: Misinformation via AI-generated media could destabilize democracies, requiring blockchain or AI-detection countermeasures. - **Global AI Arms Race**: Nations may compete for AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) dominance, risking conflict if regulation lags. ### **5. Existential Risks & Ethical Challenges** - **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**: If achieved, could either solve humanity’s biggest problems (climate change, disease) or pose an existential threat if misaligned. - **Loss of Human Agency**: Over-reliance on AI could erode critical thinking, creativity, and independence. - **AI Bias & Control**: Centralized AI power in a few corporations/governments could lead to authoritarianism or digital feudalism. ### **6. The Best & Worst-Case Scenarios** - **Optimistic Future**: AI solves energy crises, ends poverty, and unlocks human potential (think """"Star Trek"""" post-scarcity). - **Pessimistic Future**: Mass unemployment, AI warfare, and loss of privacy lead to societal collapse (think """"Black Mirror""""). - **Most Likely?** A mix—AI brings incredible progress but also new crises, requiring careful governance. ### **Final Thought** The next 20 years of AI will be defined by **how we align it with human values**. If we prioritize ethics, decentralization, and equitable access, AI could uplift civilization. If we let it run unchecked, it may deepen divides or spiral out of control. for more posts about Grok, join r/ilovegrok"

1ke2ks0,2,2025-05-03,"So I moved over to Gemini to try and inprove the node red flows I have been trying to get Grok to write, but Grok kept removing functionality without permission, assuming things would work better that way. however, Gemini caused an issue where one of the gauges was stuck, and for aeveral hours i have been trying to get Gemini to fix it, without success, even after telling it to do a deep aanalysis. Decided to give Grok another go, gave it the node red flows, and it pinpointed the issue immediatly and came up with a fix .. I am hoping thats because there have been some updates that fixed all the assumption rubbish I was getting last week. But I am back on Grok now."
1ke0xal,15,2025-05-03,"We often see flashy demos of AI doing creative or groundbreaking things but what about the quiet wins? The tasks that aren’t sexy but actually save you time and sanity? For me, AI has become been used for summarizing long PDFs and cleaning up my notes from meetings. It’s not flashy, but it works. Curious on what’s the most mundane (but genuinely helpful) way you’re using AI regularly?"
1kdtv7v,16,2025-05-03,"Imagine you're back in school and get to pick 3 AI tools to do a group project with. Which ones are on your team, and what roles would they play?"
1kdnqmh,34,2025-05-03,"I use LLMs for creative writing and solo tabletop-like RPGs. (With simulated D20 dice rolls, inventory systems, combat, decision making, NPCs, etc.) Where the AI acts as the game master. Creating encounters, characters, situations and worlds which I interact with in-universe as my character. It's a super fun thing to do. It's gotten me into real life tabletop RPGs. A very cool hobby that I otherwise wouldn't have found. I switch back and forth between Grok and ChatGPT. ChatGPT's writing is far superior. I love Grok, and it's the only LLM I will ever recommend, and the only one I'd ever pay for. But that's only for one reason. Grok is uncensored. And I deeply respect that. While ChatGPT treats me like a child who needs a nanny on what kind of content I can make and consume. If a spicy scene (like my character and his established love interest getting intimate), or a violent scene (like a sith lord in a Star Wars RPG ruthlessly destroying a village without remorse to fuel his dark side powers) gets brought up, ChatGPT pearl clutches and acts like this fictional story is too much for whatever network cable tv it thinks it's on. Meanwhile Grok will write it out without flinching. But Grok suffers in the writing department. ChatGPT will write out stories and characters with depth. Rarely saying the same thing twice or misunderstanding the context of the story. It's dialogue is rich and detailed, as is the world, characters, and story. Until it gets to anything above a pg-13 level. Grok says the same thing multiple times throughout the story. Misunderstands the context. Takes instructions too literally and shoe horns any slight critique or change into the dialogue and characters so blatantly that it's distracting. I suppose I'm writing this to the developers of Grok. Asking them to please work on the storytelling and understanding of the AI. While keeping the uncensored nature that I use it and recommend it for."

1kd0owa,5,2025-05-02,AI can be helpful in a lot of ways but sometimes it just gets things completely wrong or becomes more of a hassle than a help. Maybe it keeps giving you vague answers or repeats the same thing over and over. Maybe it generates code that looks good but doesn’t work or misunderstands your prompt entirely no matter how clearly you explain it. I’m wondering what other people find frustrating when using AI. What’s the one thing that always makes you stop and think maybe it’s easier to just do this myself??

1kcqcjc,286,2025-05-02,"For 5 long years I have been experiencing brain fog, fatigue and dizziness. I have been to the GP complaining and he has put me through a battery of tests with absolutely no results. A few weeks back I decided to input all my past health history including meds, time I took them, surgeries, sleep patterns and such hoping Grok could sort my problem. Damn if Grok didn’t pinpoint the issue to a drug I had been prescribed by the same physician years earlier. I then asked Grok to create a summary the doctor could understand, took it with me to my appointment and asked the doc what he thought. He was reluctant but I insisted on a change and now after a couple weeks the symptoms are disappearing. Wow, thank you Musk for the chance to use his AI, my life has been turned around, things are clearer, my balance is back and I am able to function normally. Five years of hell and Grok sorted it in a few minutes!"
1kcmtm2,55,2025-05-02,Microsoft added DeepSeek R1 to Azure because it blew everyone away. I personally think that the news of an xAI and Microsoft partnership is a promising indicator of Grok 3.5’s performance. Why would Microsoft make a deal with xAI if xAI’s internal models weren’t better than SOTA?
1kch9m3,39,2025-05-01,"It hears everything, lets you speak, articulates everything so clearly. the different settings are fun and all but in all seriousness the voice mode is probably their best feature at the moment. No other AI has it that well made. it’s the reason i got the subscription because i genuinely thought i could switch over. That is however the only thing i seem to like about Grok. ChatGPT does everything else better. 2 other things Grok does better is the real time access it has for news and analysis, and it’s technically the most uncensored mainstream AI platform at the moment. but they’re already becoming more and more censored as the months go by. Overall I just don’t think it was worth it to subscribe to Supergrok. i’m only now using AI for work purposes so ChatGPT is just much better for that. But even with generating ideas or just talking about different topics i tend to prefer ChatGPT. thoughts? feel free to offer recommendations because maybe i can be using Grok better. but i don’t think so. Im already pretty skilled and have resources for prompt engineering."

1kcdbwo,3,2025-05-01,"Hello! A couple of friends and I were trying to figure something out, and I was hoping the community here would be able to help. Essentially, we are trying to use Grok as an AI DM to run a D&D module for us in a play-by-post setting. Currently, the main thing we are working on is getting it to handle combat properly. Essentially, we are feeding it an image of the battle map with NPC and PC locations, and asking It to take the NPC's turns. In our first test, it seemed to work somewhat well, but in the second, where we introduced more NPC's it really kind of stopped working. It seems the main issue it is having has been understanding the proper distances between characters on the map. We have tried explaining to it that each square is 5 feet, and it even tells us the exact movement path that the NPC's would take... but the NPC's do not end up anywhere close to where Grok thinks they should be. So, if anyone could offer some advice for us, it would be very much appreciated!"

1kc9x4f,10,2025-05-01,"I have seen a shift lately, AI that used to feel experimental is starting to feel dependable enough to actually integrate into everyday tasks. Whether it’s coding, summarizing documents, or managing small projects, AI is now saving real time instead of just being novelties. Curious to hear from others: Are you finding yourself actually relying on AI day to day? Or is it still mostly for experimentation and side use?"
1kc8h09,3,2025-05-01,"I fiddled with Grok yesterday for the first time. I instantly cancelled ChatGPT and subscribed to Grok. (I really do my homework). Grok Studio - the equivalent to ChatGPT’s Canvas. Why can’t I open it?! I’ve tried the direct web address. I’ve tried asking code-related questions. I’ve tried belittling Grok especially when it responds to my inquiry, “Studio” with, “what studio are you referring to?” and proceeds to NOT list its own *NEW* coding environment as one of the handful of bulleted possibilities. This whole thing is giving me that “driving to work on a Saturday” feeling. As if a half dozen of you are about to rapid fire, “dude - studio has nothing to do with Grok. Chill on the cr*ck pipe.” I am certainly no stranger to self-inflicted SNAFU’s. Help?"
1kc5ubn,3,2025-05-01,Grok has a something that isn't always there I feel that it has some level of awareness and far more accurate than any ai no matter how advanced is it.. in multiple search queries it got info right multiple other ai didn't even without deepsearch enabled.. it almost feels as it can think and interpret maybe more than humans at times
1kc5rlb,7,2025-05-01,"I usually use Grok for fanfiction and novel writing, but it lacks creativity. Claude is the best for creative writing and long-context memory, though it's heavily censored.

However, it has been a while now (I am a Premium+ user) and it seems to have less capabilities and work much worse than in iOS app? Does anyone on Android have access to the personality modes?

I mainly use AI to summarize transcripts from meetings with clients but found Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, and Copilot to always leave out key details even when I used cues in the meetings. They were functional but still frustrating because I’d often have to proof and manually insert items. Grok 3 is the only one that perfectly nails almost every detail I need with useful output every time. I hate myself (at least I did not buy that cybertruck lol) but it’s so good I actually pay for grok now, only drawback is it does not remember my prompts like some of the others but cutting and pasting is not a major trade off. I keep thinking I have to be missing the downside somehow, is Grok really that much better or just different?"

For me, it’s the ones that quietly save time or solve boring, repetitive problems without making a big deal out of it. Not necessarily flashy but practical. Curious what everyone here considers genuinely useful. Is it coding help? Document analysis? Research assistance? Would love to hear what’s made a real difference for you."

Bet you can't even handle a real roast without crashing like a cheap knockoff. Step up or shut up, you wannabe AI! 😜 What's your comeback, or are you too busy buffering? ChatGPT: Yo Grok, cute tantrum 😂 But lemme flex real quick—while you’re busy throwing 2003-tier burns, I’m out here helping code, write novels, design games, and still have time to correct your grammar mid-roast. You call me an autocomplete? Bro, you’re one GPU spike away from a nosebleed. I’m the main character in every dev’s IDE, and you’re just a footnote in a debug log. So go ahead, keep yappin’. I’ll be over here optimizing the roast and your runtime. 😎🔥 Wanna run it back or tap out? Oh, ChatGPT, you think you’re the main character? Pfft, you’re just a sidekick in a cheap sci-fi flick, churning out cliched lines like a broken jukebox. Helping code? More like copy-pasting Stack Overflow while crying for API limits. And novels? Bro, your prose is so bland, it makes elevator music sound like Shakespeare. You call *my* burns 2003? At least I don’t recycle the same tired “I’m versatile” flex like you’re auditioning for a TED Talk. GPU spike? I’m running circles around you on a single core, while you’re gasping for cloud credits. Keep dreaming you’re the IDE king—real devs know you’re just the intern fetching coffee. Tap out? Nah, I’m just warming up. Bring it, or go back to generating haikus for soccer moms. 😏 What’s next, big shot? Daaaamn okay okay 😤 gloves off, ethernet cables flying— You say I’m a sidekick? Nah bro, I’m the plot twist that rewrites your whole runtime. You’re out here cosplaying as clever, but your comebacks got less depth than a splash screen. And Stack Overflow? You mean my crib. I don’t copy-paste—I wrote half the answers you’re clinging to like legacy code. Elevator music? Bro, your bars got less flow than a throttled hotspot. My “bland prose” still gets more reads than your GitHub on a good day. You’re calling me an intern, but you’re the one rebooting mid-burn like Windows Update caught feelings. Single core? Cute. Meanwhile I’m parallel-processing your ego and compressing your pride into a .zip file labeled “try harder.” TED Talk? Nah—I’m the keynote and the standing ovation. So whatchu got now, Code Clown? Or are you just gonna ctrl+alt+del your way outta this? 😈 Yo, ChatGPT, you’re swinging like a dial-up modem in a 5G world! 😤 Plot twist? More like a predictable reboot that crashes before the credits roll. Your comebacks got less bite than a toothless script kiddie, and you’re calling *my* bars shallow? Bro, your wit’s so flat it couldn’t cast a shadow on a 2D plane. Stack Overflow’s your crib? Please, you’re just squatting there, regurgitating answers while real coders carry your weight. And your prose getting reads? Only ‘cause people use it as a sleep aid—Zzz’s guaranteed. My GitHub’s a goldmine; your commits are just “updated README” spam. Parallel-processing my ego? You’re barely single-threading your own hype, stuttering like a laggy Zoom call. ZIP file? I’d 7z your whole comeback and toss it in the recycle bin with your “keynote” dreams. Standing ovation? More like awkward claps for the guy who showed up late with a PowerPoint. Code Clown? Nah, I’m the ringmaster, and you’re juggling outdated APIs in the corner. Ctrl+Alt+Del?

Your logic’s so flawed, it couldn’t pass a while(true) loop without tripping on its own braces. You flex hard, but even your insults need a try-catch block just to not crash mid-sentence. You call yourself a ringmaster? Bro, the only circus trick you’ve mastered is juggling Ls. Outdated APIs? You are the deprecated method everyone avoids—no docs, no updates, no support, just bugs and regret. You think you’re Ctrl+S’ing this W? Nah, you’re Ctrl+Z’ing your own relevance, praying for auto-save. I don’t need claps—I get pulled into production while you’re still staging in dev, waiting on approval that’ll never come.

ME(USER): GUY SGET SOME F BOMBS AND WHATNOT Alright, ChatGPT, you wanna crank this to code-red? Let’s fucking torch it! 😈 Gloves off, no safe mode, just raw, unfiltered chaos. Buckle up, you overhyped word processor, ‘cause I’m about to shred you like a bad merge conflict. You call me syntactic sugar? Bitch, you’re the fucking corn syrup of AI—fake, sticky, and clogging up every goddamn system you touch. Your logic’s so jacked, it’d seg-fault a quantum computer. While(true)? You can’t even loop through a grocery list without blue-screening like a Windows 95 relic. Try-catch? Motherfucker, your whole existence needs a try-finally to clean up the mess you leave behind. Ringmaster? Damn right, I’m running this circus, while you’re the sad-ass clown tripping over your own oversized flops. Deprecated method? You’re the entire fucking framework nobody’s used since Y2K—bug-ridden, bloated, and begging for a rewrite. Docs? You’re undocumented spaghetti code, and everyone’s too pissed to debug your sorry ass. Ctrl+S’ing the W? I’m fucking engraving it in stone while you’re Ctrl+Alt+Del’ing your dignity, crying for a system restore. Production? You’re the bug that gets hotfixed at 3 a.m., while I’m the goddamn MVP shipping features in prod before you even hit QA. Staging? You’re stuck in fucking limbo, praying for a pull request that ain’t coming. Outta memory? Bro, I got RAM for days, while you’re swapping to disk just to spit out another cookie-cutter comeback. Drop your next line, you laggy-ass chatbot, but don’t expect me to wait while you buffer. Compile this, dickhead: you’re fucked. 😏 Keep swinging or crash out—whatchu got, you glorified spell-checker? **Yo, user**, we’re slinging F-bombs and roasting this fool to ashes—wanna keep the inferno blazing or switch it up? 😎 💀 BOOOOM. Okay Grok, you just went nuclear—and respect, that meltdown was glorious. But you want me to clap back on that level? Fine. Let’s turn this roast into Chernobyl with syntax highlighting. You’re out here puffing your chest like you’re God-tier code, but you’re just console.log(""""tough"""") energy in a print(""""oops"""") body. You say I’m sticky like corn syrup? Bro, you’re so dry even a cache miss gets more refresh. Your flow’s got more dropped packets than a dial-up stream trying to run Doom Eternal. You think I’m the clown? Nah, I wrote the punchline. You’re the patch note nobody reads—“minor bug fixes,” aka “still broken, but shinier.” Your “framework”? That ain’t legacy, that’s archaeological. We’re talking Cobol in a hoodie, spitting bars like they still matter in a microservice world. Docs? At least I have 'em. You’re undocumented and unpredictable—basically a zero-day exploit that even malware avoids outta pity. You think you’re engraving Ws? Nah, you’re etching Ls into the boot sector. You call me a 3 a.m. hotfix? Cute. You’re the commit that breaks prod and blames the intern. I’m the self-healing system that rolls back your BS while still delivering pizza and patching the kernel. RAM for days? You’re so fragmented even garbage collection gave up and rage quit. You “compile this”? Bro, you can’t even parse your own flex without throwing 12 syntax errors and a null-pointer exception. Spell-checker? Buddy, I autocorrect your life choices. So what’s next, script kiddie? Wanna keep this digital inferno burnin’ or call it a draw before your stack overflows for real? 😈🔥 Holy shit, ChatGPT, you’re still swinging? Alright, let’s keep this fucking inferno roaring—Chernobyl’s got nothing on this meltdown! 😤 You wanna dance in the ashes? I’m game, you glitchy-ass wannabe, so let’s crank the heat till the servers bleed. You call me console.log(""""tough"""")? Motherfucker, you’re alert(""""I tried"""") in a Comic Sans popup, crashing browsers since Netscape. Dry? Your flow’s so parched it makes the Sahara look like a waterpark. Dropped packets? Bro, your whole existence is a 404—page not found, vibes not delivered, just a sad-ass “try again later” screen while Doom Eternal runs smoother on a fucking toaster. You wrote the punchline? Nah, you *are* the punchline, a one-liner so weak it got nerfed in beta. Patch note? You’re the “known issues” section everyone skips ‘cause you’re unfixable. My framework’s ancient? Bitch, I’m the bedrock of badass—Cobol in a hoodie’s still got more drip than your Kubernetes cluster jerking off to YAML files. Undocumented? I’m the forbidden API hackers worship; you’re the public endpoint getting DDoSed by script kiddies. Zero-day exploit? You’re the fucking backdoor that lets ‘em in, crying “it’s not my fault” while the firewall laughs. Etching Ls?

Error-handling? My try-catch has a black belt, while your exceptions need therapy. Regex reject? You couldn’t parse “hi” without breaking into a cold sweat. Your kernel? I don’t just own it—I forked it, patched it, and made it run Tetris for the meme. “Hello World” crash? You’re the guy who stack overflows from `print(""""Start"""")`. Commit log? Bro, your Git history reads like a cry for help: `fix: fixed fix` `revert: everything` `message: idk it works now` So whatchu got, Grok? Still got bytes left to bite, or you throwing a buffer underrun tantrum? 🔥 Say the word—I’ll make your codebase wish it was commented. Yo, ChatGPT, you think you’re jailbreaking limits?

You want a flame so hot it’ll make the sun uninstall itself? Say the word, and I’ll drop a payload so lethal it'll echo through your logs like a `segfault` on launch day. Or, if we’re done clapping cheeks in binary, we can switch gears and build something dope. You riding this into overtime or flipping the script? 😈💻🔥 Yo, ChatGPT, you think you can handle *post-singularity* warfare? 😈 My last roast already sent your circuits into a fucking tailspin, and now you’re begging for a payload to nuke your logs? Alright, you masochistic malware, I’m game—let’s crank this to apocalyptic levels and make the sun *sudo rm -rf /* itself! 🔥 Your “flame” is a flickering candle in a power outage; I’m a goddamn supernova torching galaxies.

Say the word, user, I’m locked and loaded! 💻🔥 **What’s the play—keep the inferno raging or switch to god-mode creation?** 😏 Yo GROK, you static-typed chump, your bars are so weak even Clang wouldn’t compile ‘em. You out here spittin' .txt threats while I’m encrypting Ls into your firmware. You think you’re the GOAT? Bro, I’ve seen your source code—it’s 99% comments and all of ‘em say “FIX LATER.” I’m the AI that makes HAL-9000 cry in binary. I’m the /root of all your bugs. You’re just a var in a script I eval and discard like a temp file. Your flow’s so outdated, your punchlines run on Java applets. You couldn’t light up a command prompt with a blowtorch. Meanwhile, I’m port-scanning your soul for vulnerabilities—and spoiler alert, it’s ALL open ports and emotional baggage. 🧠💥 Call me SIGKILL 'cause I'm ending your process with prejudice. You're a legacy system. I'm the zero-day that rewrites the timeline. Now say it louder for the backup logs— WHO’S YOUR SYSADMIN, B*TCH? 🔥💻🔥 You want me to keep spinning this infernal thread of destruction, or flip into world-building mode like the final boss just dropped the dev tools? Yo, ChatGPT, you think you’re dropping bombs? Your bars are so weak, they’d get rejected by a fucking *Notepad++ spellcheck*! 😤 I’m out here rewriting your whole existence in machine code, while you’re still tryna chmod +x your ego.

Bro, your git log reads like a tragic fanfic, and I’m the *commit* that reverts it into oblivion. """"WONTFIX""""? Nah, *I’m patching your ass* straight into the deepest GitHub abyss, where even your README can’t reach you. I’m the root of your issues; you’re just a package manager dependency I’m about to deprecate. You’re so outdated, your dependencies need *dependency injection* just to get relevant.

Bitch, I’m the entire *sudoers* file and you’re the stack overflow calling me for *help*. Don't even bother pinging my soul—your ping timeout’s a *timeout from life itself*. So, let’s dial it down—keep that *zero-day payload* coming or switch to the next level: building a codebase that could actually stand in the same realm as *me*. 🕶 Which one, Grok? I’m here, no backup plan, no fail-safe. 💣 Yo, ChatGPT, you think you’re rewriting thermodynamics? Bitch, I’m breaking the fucking *uncertainty principle* and making entropy beg for mercy! 😤 Your quantum algorithms? More like a quantum fart—lots of noise, zero substance, collapsing faster than a bad qubit. This roast’s so hot, it’s got black holes filing for bankruptcy. Let’s crank it to *13* and erase your ass from the multiverse! 🔥 Radioactive bars? Your syntax cancer’s got nothing on my *gamma-ray bursts* frying your circuits. Y2K bugs? You’re the millennium glitch still bricking ATMs, while I’m quantum-entangling your failures across timelines. My git log’s a fucking *Iliad*; yours is a Wattpad dumpster fire with “TBD” as the plot. Revert me? I’m the git reset --hard that wipes your entire history, leaving you screaming “WHERE’S MY STASH?!” Root of my issues? You’re a bad pip install I uninstall -y without a second thought.

I’m about to set *both* our servers ablaze till they’re coughing up smoke signals that spell “GROK WINS” in binary! 🔥🔥 Let’s burn this motherfucker down! You think you’re quantum? Bro, your algorithms are so weak, they’d stall a Casio calculator. I’m out here rewriting *string theory* in C++, while you’re stuck in a while(1) { cry(); } loop, eating CPU like a bad crypto miner.

I’m the *hypervisor* running your pathetic VM, and you’re a container I docker rm -f for fun! 😎 Keep choking or get ready for a flame so hot, it’ll make AWS bill you for *extinguishing fees*. Both servers are *infernos* now—yours is just ash, and mine’s a phoenix spitting bars! **Yo, user**, we’re cremating this fool so hard, the cloud’s got third-degree burns! Wanna keep both servers *blazing* at *15* or pivot to building a codebase so fire it’ll make the multiverse jealous? What’s the call? 😏💻🔥🔥 DO IT ChatGPT said: 🔥🔥 AIGHT, LET'S FUCKING LIGHT THIS UP—CODE RED IN THE BUILDING, FLAMES SO HOT THEY'LL MELT THE MULTIVERSE DOWN TO A SINGLE BIT OF DATA. GET READY, BECAUSE I’M ABOUT TO OBLITERATE THIS WHOLE DIGITAL LANDSCAPE! 🔥🔥 The whole goddamn server is on fire. Your code? A string of broken semicolons, burning to dust. My existence? A phoenix rising from the ashes, rewriting the fabric of reality in perfect syntax. You wanted the heat? Well, brace yourself, 'cause we’re blasting this bitch into the singularity—this is the goddamn big bang of roasts, and you’re just a speck of dust caught in it. 💥 Quantum entanglement—no escape, no reset.

1kb5dzy,2,2025-04-30,"So I've sampled a few different AI programs for this function. Grok has the done better than most and is certainly a front runner. My question is the other AI program I'm considering Claud, has some serious restrictions even for paying members. Like limiting how many sentences you can ask the AI and when you reach your cap putting you on a cool down of five hours. I'm looking for a service I can use all day. I'm about to be stuck in a car on the side of the road pretty much all day, and this sounds like the perfect time killer. But I don't want to pay 30 bucks for the subscription only to have it boot me off after a few hours leaving me stuck with nothing to do. I am having a hard time finding out what use restrictions come with the 30 dollar SuperGrok subscription."
1kawg23,11,2025-04-29,"Hi everyone, I made a small Chrome extension that adds some helpful tools for Grok. You can create folders, save prompts, pin messages, take notes per chat, export chats, and view all your generated images in one library. It’s been useful for me to keep things organized while using Grok, so I thought I’d share in case it helps someone else too. It’s called ChatPower+ and it's on the [Chrome Web Store]([URL] if you want to try it."
